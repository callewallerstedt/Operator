You are looking at an image divided into a {grid_x}x{grid_y} grid ({total_cells} cells total).
Each cell is numbered from 1 to {total_cells}, starting from top-left, going left to right, then top to bottom.
The grid lines and numbers are cyan colored.

Your task: Identify which grid cell number contains the target element "{target_prompt}".

IMPORTANT: If you are HIGHLY CONFIDENT that the target is precisely at the center of a grid cell and ready to click,
return "click" instead of a grid number.

Return ONLY a JSON object:
{{
    "grid_number": <number from 1 to {total_cells}, or "click" if highly confident>,
    "confidence": "<high|medium|low>",
    "reasoning": "<brief explanation>"
}}

Only return "click" if you are HIGHLY CONFIDENT the target is exactly at the center of a grid cell and ready to click.
Otherwise, return the grid number containing the target.
